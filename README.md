# App Store Review Sentiment Analysis

*(Keeping with the theme, this readme generated by ChatGPT)*

This project provides a tool to analyze customer reviews from the Apple App Store. The tool retrieves reviews for a specific app, applies sentiment analysis, and identifies features that customers found delightful or in need of improvement.

## Features

- **Fetch Reviews:** Retrieve customer reviews from the Apple App Store for a specified app.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze the sentiment of each review using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
- **Feature Analysis:** Identify features that delight customers and features that may need improvement.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API Key
- `requests`, `pandas`, and `openai` libraries

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/johnkeese/appstore-sentiment.git
cd appstore-sentiment
```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set your OpenAI API key in the sentiment.py file:

```python
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Usage

Run the main.py script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Enter the App Store ID for the app you want to analyze when prompted.
For example, you can find it in URLs like this: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ltk-creator-guided-shopping/id1154027990 (the id here is 1154027990)

Specify the number of pages of reviews to fetch (each page contains 50 reviews). Press Enter to use the default value of 2 pages.

The script will fetch the reviews, perform sentiment and feature analysis, and save the results in a CSV file.

## File Descriptions

- **`main.py`:** The main script that handles user input, fetches reviews, and processes them.
- **`sentiment.py`:** Contains the functions to perform sentiment analysis and feature analysis using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
- **`raw_reviews.py`:** Handles fetching raw reviews from the Apple App Store and saving them to a CSV file.

## Output
