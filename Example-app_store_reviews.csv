Instagram nightmare,To brittanyxavier I am not interested in shopping using this app. I am not one of your puppet and you will not earn anything from me. As soon as I can I will BLOCK YOU. Done as of 8/20/24 @ 1615,2024-08-20T14:15:40-07:00,1
App will not load,"I’m not sure what’s happened to this app, but the app will not load. I’ve deleted it and reinstalled it, but it still will not load. The app works fine if I click on a link and it opens in Instagram, but it will not launch/load when the app is opened from my phone.",2024-08-18T07:24:01-07:00,2
Great but,Would love it to be easier to get to my favorites. It seems like the algorithm is always just instead suggesting things I would like. To find the ones I want to check regularly. I have to search their name each time.,2024-08-18T06:12:36-07:00,4
Love it!,It’s my go to for anything and everything.,2024-08-17T07:03:15-07:00,5
Does this app ever work?,Is it just my phone or does this app RARELY load when clicked on? Very frustrating.,2024-08-16T15:30:41-07:00,1
Makes shopping easy & fun!,This is my go-to app when I'm looking for that special gift or something unique.  LTK makes shopping fun again!,2024-08-15T19:21:44-07:00,5
Broken,There have been so many bugs where it would just kick me out of the app if I click on an item and so I deleted and redownloaded the app but now it is just stuck on the opening screen with the logo and doesn’t load!,2024-08-14T11:44:55-07:00,1
Intrusive,"This app violates boundaries. I have notifications turned off on most apps; but even with notifications turned off on this app, it continues to have notifications on my Home Screen with the app and when I open up the app. The notification at times says “make sure to turn on notifications so you don’t miss out.” No. I have them turned off for a reason…why are you notifying me of something I don’t want to be notified of and have explicitly asked to not have notifications. This is annoying, unnecessary, and not a good look. Please change this as a way of demonstrating basic respect and an honoring of your users’ experience. Happy to change my review when these changes are made!",2024-08-13T10:10:03-07:00,1
Doesn’t Work,I used to love this app then an update ago broke the app and now all I get is the loading screen. 😣,2024-08-12T13:28:02-07:00,1
Guy options,This app is a real game-changer but I don’t see any guys trending their clothes and fashion sense. I’m a guy and the whole discovery seems women-based. I hope to see the app thrive off mutual gender clothing,2024-08-07T13:24:41-07:00,3
Always Informative,Love it,2024-08-04T09:21:31-07:00,5
Stop refreshing the app,"I loved this app until recently it started refreshing back to the home page every time I click on a product and it opens in another app. It’s extremely frustrating and it sure doesn’t help the content creators I follow, either. Please make it stop refreshing.",2024-08-04T07:57:17-07:00,3
Hating today’s update!,One of my most used apps but I am hating whatever they’ve changed since yesterday! I want to see a preview of the link/price before automatically taking me to the item. Also hate how the reels now play!,2024-08-03T09:25:11-07:00,3
Iron out the video issues please,"Overall I like this app but the update is not great at all. You can’t see the bottom of the videos and the sound on the videos is there sometimes, sometimes not, or I have to click up the volume once to get the sound to work. 
Very frustrating 😞",2024-08-03T02:03:15-07:00,3
stop the refresh,i would rate the app 5 stars if everytime you left the app it didn't refresh back to the homepage. it makes me not even want to use the app especially because the point of linking the outfits is to purchase them/browse them on their website - that gets defeated when i return back to LTK and have to find the creator all over again because the app went back to the homepage. quite infuriating and i have closed the app in frustration multiple times because of this. its a small thing but super tedious once you've scrolled a long way to find stuff.,2024-07-30T09:49:16-07:00,3
Won’t update or load,"This app changed since it was updated and nothing loads on it. No content, no creators, just constant error messages. Such a shame as I love it ages ago. Now I can’t catch up with my favorite content providers or shop through socials.",2024-07-27T14:56:26-07:00,1
I DON’T LIKE,I don’t like the idea of me automatically following someone just because I clicked their profile. I want to make the decision to follow people.,2024-07-24T00:25:02-07:00,1
Need To Fix Bugs,"I love the idea of LTK. However, there are a few bugs that need to be fixed. When I click to follow someone, it does not save when I go back to the homepage and only two of the people appear. Also, the app is just very slow. Live LTK, but the app could use some improvement.",2024-07-20T06:38:54-07:00,3
Joolz,Awesome,2024-07-19T16:15:02-07:00,5
Becoming a creater,I have applied like 6 times I have different things I belong to like lemon 8 instagram and Tictoc they still didn’t consider me very upsetting I’m ready to call them on this .. !!! And they this are all connected for them to get access too! Nancimetzgar !,2024-07-17T02:08:19-07:00,1
Love it!,I love being able to go to my favorite influencers page to see where they got everything from in their reels.,2024-07-13T06:24:09-07:00,5
really good,you can find any creators and find where they get their stuff (if they link it) super convenient,2024-07-11T19:05:19-07:00,5
I,I have to say I’ve been so happy with this app till 2 days ago.  I messaged them asking them why I can’t see what the influencer share. It takes me to a clear page where it’s saying error every single time I want to check what they sharing.,2024-07-10T19:16:43-07:00,1
Awesome,Awesome app with the best finds!,2024-07-09T06:53:45-07:00,5
App changed,I don’t like the new version of the app. I can’t see the products at the bottom of the page. They doesn’t even show the whole image of the photo of the products. :(,2024-07-06T19:17:00-07:00,1
Absolutely love this app!,"It is so nice to be able to save posts and favorite items, as well as click on the item which takes me over to the website. I get tons of compliments on my outfits! Such a great app! Fun to see new creators and check out different posts.",2024-07-06T16:41:42-07:00,5
not clear only for women,would be nice to know this app isn’t for men before downloading it,2024-07-06T14:40:18-07:00,1
Hate the new carousel feature of links vs the grid,"Hate the new carousel feature of links vs the grid, terrible update",2024-07-05T20:53:08-07:00,2
What’s with the wiggle?,The product pop up wiggling is super annoying. Enough so I’m ready to stop using what is otherwise a pretty useful app,2024-07-05T17:33:49-07:00,3
Great source but…,Wish you could search the influencers you currently follow when looking for an item instead of just a general search on the platform.,2024-06-30T13:10:09-07:00,4
The PERFECT app,"LTK makes shopping so much easier. If I see something I like, I want the exact item, not something similar that I have to search for. LTK gives you the link to the item you’re looking at. I just love it!",2024-06-30T07:56:16-07:00,5
Keeps refreshing and losing place,"Every time I click on a link and then go back to my LTK feed it's now refreshing the entire feed and I lose my place! Even doing a specific search, if click on a link and go back to LTK, the app refreshes and takes me back to my feed, losing my search results and my place. This is making shopping the app incredibly frustrating!!",2024-06-26T08:04:48-07:00,2
has a few issues,"i use LTK a lot and i love it! it has so much inspiration from so many creators and you can follow, like, and comment on posts. one of the issues i dont like is that some posts’s audio don’t work and it’s kinda annoying. one other kink I dont like is on the recommended home page, it always shows the most recent posts of creators that i follow, and it doesnt ever change (most of the time), so i basically have to look at the same stuff until someone posts again. also, if you click on a post, and you go to the account of the post, you cant swipe to see other posts by them. instead you have to leave that post and scroll to see other posts. im sure there are other things that bug me but I dont really remember rn so if u want fashion inspo I would just stick to Pinterest but that’s just my opinion !",2024-06-24T17:01:54-07:00,3
Living with Landyn,I cannot tell you how much I love this lady!! She is so down to earth and truly is a joy to watch what’s going on in her life. I love her sweet kids Lily and Luke. I feel like I know this family and we’re best friends!!  lol ❤️,2024-06-21T11:27:35-07:00,5
Never works right,"Anytime I click on someone’s link from Insta it doesn’t work, then when I try and search the user it won’t pull up. This app isn’t great!",2024-06-19T18:45:03-07:00,1
Great App,Love that all the fashions are on here!,2024-06-18T11:34:36-07:00,5
cool app!,It’s a cool app and helps you pick out outfit inspo so id give it 4⭐️,2024-06-16T08:25:51-07:00,4
Love your finds,I’ve bought so many of your outfits and actually wearing one as I write this review Thank you for making styling affordable 😀,2024-06-08T04:46:44-07:00,5
L O V E this app! Just one request though…,I absolutely love this app! I’ve found so many great products and amazing deals while using this app. I just have one request… could we move the like/comment/share bar from off of the actual post? Sometimes there are things behind it like a price that I can’t read. I can’t be the only one that’s wishing for this. Lol.,2024-06-05T06:24:41-07:00,5
Love this,This app gives me tons of outfit ideas in presents. It’s really useful when you don’t know what to wear or give somebody.,2024-06-02T19:49:42-07:00,5
great app,"i love this app so much, the idea behind it is genius. but i don’t love the way parts of it works, and it is verrrrrrry slow.",2024-05-31T12:22:05-07:00,4
The new update made the app unusable!,"I updated the app that was working perfectly fine before I updated it. Now it closes automatically when I click on a link to shop for the items shared by influencers. 
This makes the app no longer useful. Sadly I don’t know if there are other apps I can use that are similar to this one and actually work. 
I will make the difficult decision of deleting the app and apparently erasing all my data.",2024-05-28T20:53:42-07:00,1
Me encanta!,Me encanta encontrar rápidamente mis looks favoritos y sobretodo tener modelos de inspiración de como vestir.,2024-05-27T20:36:52-07:00,5
Love LTK!,"Love the app! Great outfit ideas with links to almost all of the items. 
I just don’t like that it will automatically have you follow someone’s profile if your checking out a look.",2024-05-25T06:02:30-07:00,5
My go to app,I love this app!  It keep me abreast of the latest fashion and work trends.,2024-05-24T17:59:14-07:00,5
Great concept but,Everyone seems to be sponsored by Amazon so they are all promoting the same 10 things,2024-05-19T02:04:21-07:00,3
Great Resource!,"Provided the Contant creator actually matches items exactly to the link where they can be shopped, this is one of the best shopping resources.",2024-05-18T05:02:13-07:00,5
Great App,It’s great for ideas and useful,2024-05-09T12:28:47-07:00,5
This app is great shopping for everyone.,"I love this app for customizing a curated variety of cute and affordable items ( not just clothes: purses, shoes, home furnishings too).  Plan to keep checking it out.",2024-05-09T07:34:09-07:00,5
Tennis shorts,Very cute 🫶🏾,2024-05-08T19:12:48-07:00,5
